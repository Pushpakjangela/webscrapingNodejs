This movie is a fun ride from start to finish. The characters are well projected and have a solid background, but more importantly the storyline is well written without flaws, which makes this clean comedy. Bravo Priyadarshan!!!PS:Never thought someone would give a leading role to Paresh RawalI give it a 9/10"
